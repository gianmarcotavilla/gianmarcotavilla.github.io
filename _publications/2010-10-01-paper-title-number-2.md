excerpt: 'The typification of the Linnaean name Allium fistulosum (Amaryllidaceae) is revised by superseding the previous proposal (neotype). Due to the existing original material (Dodoens' illustration), the neotypification is not correct according to Art. 9.13 of the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Shenzhen Code). In addition, an herbarium specimen kept at S-LINN is designated as epitype to ensure the correct application of the name.'
