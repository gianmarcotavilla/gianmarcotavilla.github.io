excerpt: "The typification of Salvia kurdica Boiss. & Hohen. ex Benth. and Salvia macrochlamys Boiss. & Kotschy ex Boiss. is discussed. Herbarium research was carried out at A, B, G, GH, GOET, HAL, JE, K, M, MEL, MO, P, S, and U. These two names were inadvertently lectotypified, and therefore, require second-step lectotypification. The designated lectotypes of S. kurdica and S. macrochlamys are kept at G. These lectotypifications maintain the current taxonomic concept of the names."
