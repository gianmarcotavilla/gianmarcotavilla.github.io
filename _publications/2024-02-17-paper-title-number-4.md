excerpt: "A new species, Cyclamen brulloi, is described and illustrated from Sicily (Italy). This is an Autumn flowering species belonging to Cyclamen subg. Cyclamen and it is currently restricted to some localities of western Sicily, where it grows on carbonatic rocks and in rocky crevices. This taxon shows close relationships both with C. hederifolium and C. africanum. However, several morphological and karyological features are clearly different. Morphology, pollen grain micromorphology, karyology (2n = 4x = 68), ecology, conservation status and taxonomic relationships of the new taxon with the most allied species are presented."
